            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am Graduated from <a href="https://sustech.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SUSTech</a>, a BS in Financial Engineering.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="campus-life-in-sustech">Campus Life in SUSTech<a class="hash-link" href="#campus-life-in-sustech" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>I stayed in Computer Science department for three years and finished all compulsory courses and almost gained enough credits to get a BS in Computer Science. My major was changed to Ocean Science and Engineering by some mistakes caused by the teaching affair office. I wrote emails to many administrators. I used to stand in front of some administrators' offices for hours to meet them in person. After one year's attempts, I moved to Finance Department and gain all creadits with high grades in two semesters. Meanwhile, I started a company and managaed a team to do some real projects so that I can keep my programming skills sharpe. Now I'm back to the industry and working for <a href="https://singularity-data.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singularity Data</a> as a full stack engineer.</p>]]></content:encoded>
