My major was changed to Ocean Science and Engineering by some mistakes caused by the teaching affair office. I wrote emails to many administrators. I used to stand in front of some administrators' offices for hours to meet them in person. After one year's attempts, I moved to Finance Department and gain all creadits with high grades in two semesters. Meanwhile, I started a company and managaed a team to do some real projects so that I can keep my programming skills sharpe.
